# SwiftUIRant

An unofficial devRant iOS client (that doesn't crash).

## Goals

* The first goal of this project is to provide the functionality to browse through rants, write comments, ++/-- (vote), and favorite/unfavorite rants.
* A "Notif" screen to see ++'s, Mentions, and so on.
* Then, I want to provide the functionality to create rants and other types of posts and upload images.

The first version of the app should provide a better experience for the main and most frequently used functions of the app.

Secondary functions like editing the own profile may be added later but are not considered high priority at the moment.

## Motivation

My motivation for this this project is to have a native iOS devRant app that is not crashing and has some improved UI/UX over the official devRant iOS app.

And I want wo build it in SwiftUI to improve my skills and because I think that SwiftUI is a fun and amazing UI framework.
